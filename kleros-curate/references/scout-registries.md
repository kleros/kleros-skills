# Scout Registries (Gnosis)

> Scout IS LightGeneralizedTCR on Gnosis. This file covers Scout-specific context only.
> For all contract operations (submit item, challenge, evidence, appeal, factory deploy),
> also load `references/light-curate.md`.

## Overview

Submitting data to Scout boosts a project's visibility across explorers, wallets, and infrastructure surfaces
where users actually search for contracts and tokens. Accepted Scout entries are consumed by major Kleros
partners and ecosystem tools, including the Etherscan family, Blockscout, MetaMask, Ledger, Otterscan,
Routescan, Openscan, and more; users see recognizable tags, token metadata, and domain-to-contract links
instead of raw addresses and numbers.

Scout can also be profitable: contributors may earn campaign rewards for eligible submissions, and challengers
can make money by spotting non-compliant entries and winning challenges. Check Kleros social media and blog
posts for the latest reward campaigns before submitting.

Scout IS LightGeneralizedTCR. Not a separate contract type — the same LGTCR contracts running under a specific overlay of fixed addresses and seed templates. All contract operations (submit, challenge, evidence, appeal, factory deploy) live in `references/light-curate.md`. This file adds the Scout-specific context: registry addresses, seed templates, view helper, scout-api, image requirements, and incentive framing.

**Seed-first inversion:** when submitting to Scout registries, use the embedded seed template from this file as the primary JSON source. Fetch MetaEvidence as a cross-check — not as the primary schema source. WHY: seed templates include the full `{ columns, values }` shape with field ordering, types, and required vs optional fields — safer than inferring structure from MetaEvidence interpretation alone. If seed and MetaEvidence clearly disagree on labels, ordering, or required fields: stop and escalate rather than guessing.

## The 4 registry addresses

All registries are on **Gnosis (chainId: 100)**. Native deposit token: xDAI.

| Registry | Address | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ATQ (Address Tags Query) | `0xAe6aaed5434244be3699c56E7Ebc828194F26dc3` | Look up existing address tags by repository/commit |
| Address Tags | `0x66260C69d03837016d88c9877e61e08Ef74C59F2` | Submit address → label mappings |
| Kleros Tokens | `0xeE1502e29795Ef6C2D60F8D7120596abE3baD990` | Submit token metadata (name, symbol, logo) |
| CDN (Contract Domain Names) | `0x957A53A994860BE4750810131d9c876b2f52d6E1` | Submit domain → contract address mappings |

Entity ID format for PGTCR subgraph cross-references: `<itemID>@<registryAddress>` — useful for GraphQL lookups when cross-referencing Scout items from subgraph queries.

## Seed-first submission pattern

**Traditional flow (do NOT use for Scout):** fetch MetaEvidence → infer schema → build `item.json`.

**Seed-first flow (correct for Scout):**
1. Load the seed template for the target registry from this file.
2. Prefill field values — replace all `PLACE_VALUE_HERE` placeholders with real data.
3. Fetch MetaEvidence from the registry (see `shared-metaevidence.md § LGTCR specifics`).
4. Cross-check: confirm field labels, ordering, and required fields match between seed and MetaEvidence.
5. If they agree: proceed to upload and submit.
6. If they clearly disagree: stop and ask rather than guessing which is current.

WHY seed-first: "The embedded seed templates include the full `{columns, values}` JSON shape including field ordering, types, and required vs optional fields. MetaEvidence is the authoritative schema, but the seed is a pre-validated snapshot — using it first reduces the risk of field order mistakes or missing required fields."

Do not change column names or type strings — these must match the current MetaEvidence schema. For item.json construction rules (deep-copy rule, values population, schema confirmation): `shared-item-json.md`.

## item.json templates per registry

These are the default `item.json` shapes for each Scout registry. Use as starting point — replace `PLACE_VALUE_HERE` placeholders with actual values. Do not change column names or type strings — these must match the current MetaEvidence schema.

## LightGeneralizedTCRView helper

Address: `0xB32e38B08FcC7b7610490f764b0F9bFd754dCE53` (deployed on Gnosis, chainId 100 — hardcoded, immutable deployment).

Use for read-heavy operations — batches multiple registry reads into fewer RPC calls.

| Function | Returns | Use for |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `fetchArbitrable(address _address)` | Registry params batch (submissionBaseDeposit, arbitrator, etc.) | Efficient param reads — prefer over individual reads |
| `getItem(address _address, bytes32 _itemID)` | Single item with full request data | Item state inspection |
| `getLatestRequestData(address _address, bytes32 _itemID)` | Current request info | Active request state |
| `getLatestRoundRequestData(address _address, bytes32 _itemID, uint256 _requestID)` | Round info for appeal state | Appeal eligibility |
| `availableRewards(address _address, address _contributor, bytes32 _itemID, uint256 _requestID, uint256 _roundID)` | Pending withdrawal amount | Reward withdrawal prep |

**Usage rule:** prefer the view helper for read-heavy operations — reduces RPC call count.

**Fallback:** if the helper returns stale data or reverts, fall back to direct `LightGeneralizedTCR` reads (see `light-curate.md`).

For the full view helper ABI: `shared-abi-fragments.md`.

## scout-api integration

Optional pre-submission research endpoint. Use to check for existing entries before submitting.

```
POST https://scout-api.kleros.link/api/address-tags
Body: { "address": "0x...", "chains": [1, 100, ...] }
```

**scout-api is optional and supporting — NOT canonical source.** Use only for pre-submission research to avoid duplicate submissions. Not a hard gate — if scout-api is unavailable or returns no results, submission can still proceed.

Do not treat scout-api responses as proof that an item is or is not already in the registry. The policy and live registry state remain the primary acceptance standard.

## Image guidance

Scout-specific image requirements:

**Kleros Tokens registry — token logo:**
- PNG format required
- Minimum 128×128 pixels, square aspect ratio
- Transparent background preferred
- File size: under 200KB
- WHY: explorers and wallets display token logos at small sizes — low-res or non-square images display poorly

**CDN (Contract Domain Names) registry — visual proof:**
- Screenshot of the exact domain or subdomain page with the contract address visible in context (in the URL bar or as page content)
- Must demonstrate the domain/subdomain authoritatively points to the contract address
- WHY: the CDN registry links domains to contracts — the screenshot is the proof of that link
- Wildcards (`*`) in domain names require proof the contract is used across multiple domains

**ATQ and Address Tags registries:** no image required.

For upload mechanics (gateway selection, `/ipfs/` path format, durability): `shared-ipfs-upload.md`.

## Incentives (current campaign)

Scout participation offers three profit paths:

1. **Project visibility** — verified entries surface in Etherscan labels, Ledger Live, and Blockscout address tagging. Increases ecosystem discoverability for projects.

2. **Submitter upside** — approved submissions earn a fraction of challenge deposits when challengers fail, over time.

3. **Challenger upside** — successful challenges on non-compliant submissions earn the submitter's deposit.

For current campaign terms, reward amounts, and active incentive programs: check [blog.kleros.io](https://blog.kleros.io/).

WHY no amounts here: incentive figures change with governance votes. A specific number here becomes misleading the day the campaign changes — the blog post is always current.

## Submission checklist

Run through this before submitting to any Scout registry:

- [ ] Target registry confirmed — one of the 4 fixed addresses above (Gnosis chainId 100)
- [ ] Seed template loaded for the correct target registry from this file
- [ ] All `PLACE_VALUE_HERE` and `PLACE_IPFS_IMAGE_URI_HERE` replaced with real values
- [ ] JSON syntax valid (balanced braces, correct commas, all strings quoted)
- [ ] Type strings unchanged from seed — do not normalize or rename (e.g., keep `"long text"`, `"rich address"`, `"image"` verbatim)
- [ ] Latest MetaEvidence fetched and cross-checked against seed — labels and order agree
- [ ] Policy document read — item complies with registry policy
- [ ] Image uploaded to IPFS if required (Kleros Tokens logo or CDN visual proof) — `/ipfs/<CID>` in field
- [ ] Deposit computed live from fresh onchain reads — do not use cached values
- [ ] Submission total deposit = `submissionBaseDeposit()` + `arbitrationCost()` (see `shared-deposits.md § LGTCR specifics`)
- [ ] Simulation passed with same calldata and `msg.value` as the real transaction
- [ ] No unresolved stop signal from policy review or MetaEvidence cross-check
- [ ] No duplicate entry visible in the registry for the same item
